I am a graduate student in epidemiology at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/). For my doctoral dissertation, I am developing evidence-based prediction tools that would help healthcare providers in lower- and middle-income countries to better target tuberculosis control strategies.

Prior to my graduate work, I studied in the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and conducted research on the risky decision-making process using experimental psychology techniques as my undergraduate thesis. I then worked in the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/) studying cancer survival disparities in the UK, France and Japan. 

Combining these interests, my long-term research goal is to further explore culture-specific decision-making processes under uncertainty and develop tools to inform these decisions in areas of disease prevention and treatment.
