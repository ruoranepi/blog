+ [Lindsay Jaacks](http://lindsayjaacks.com/): US meat consumption is declining, but increasing globally. In China, meat production is increasing by 2 kg per person per year. (And diabetes is associated with small elevation by half serving of meat consumption in Nurses.) Global vegetable intake is low, and fruit intake is even lower. 

+ [Carol Boushey](http://www.uhcancercenter.org/about-us/2-directory/62-carol-jo-boushey-phd): **Food co-ocurrence pattern** over time from new technologies that capture food intake. Interesting way to visualize multiple exposures. Why not use social media images as exposures for food intake? "You do not post ugly photos", but can be used as a type of input for deep learning and extract food input information.
