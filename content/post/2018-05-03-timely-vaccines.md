During WWII, the world is very productive in developing and improving many vaccines. 

Many barriers are organizational, not scientific. 

What are some of the good organizational characteristics that facilitate speedy development?

1. Top down governance
2. Integrated across developmental phases and diciplines
3. Situated in a community that facilitates information transfer

[CEPI](http://cepi.net/) (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) - defines the problem as a **speed problem**. Although basic science is not subject to speed, the translation of it is.

Argues that this is not a "low-hanging fruit" problem. There are examples and counter examples for this argument, but overall, the focus of the talk is on the declining level of innovation. Very pessimistic!
