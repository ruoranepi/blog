Transitioning from Stata to R is painful. So for over half a year, I was using base R for data cleaning and manipulation (double PAINFUL!), before finally having time to learn the many uses of the [dplyr package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html). Life is so much simpler. All thanks go to [YouTube videos from Prof. Roger Peng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aywFompr1F4): timesaver and lifesaver!
