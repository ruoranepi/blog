## Active projects

### Developing a tuberculosis risk score

I'm developing a tool to describe the distribution of TB risks in a population. [Preliminary results](/post/2019-10-31HyderabadPPT/TBburdenindex_RuoranLi_TBU_20191031.pdf) were presented at the [50th Union World Conference on Lung Health](https://hyderabad.worldlunghealth.org) in Hyderabad, India, on October 31, 2019. 

### COVID-19 inpatient resource needs

As part of my doctoral thesis, I'm estimating the inpatient hospitalization needs for COVID-19. 


## Previous projects

### TB contact investigation in Peru

I have developed tools that could inform tuberculosis contact investigation and preventive therapy for pulmonary TB patients and their contacts in Lima, Peru with [Prof. Megan Murray](http://ghsm.hms.harvard.edu/person/faculty/megan-murray).

- Some preliminary results were presented at the [16th Annual Jonathan Freeman Symposium on Infectious Disease Epidemiology](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/idepi/httpccdd-hsph-harvard-edueventsid-epi-spring-seminar-series-starts-in-feb/) on Apr 27, 2018, and the [49th Union World Conference on Lung Health](2018/10/23/poster-video-at-tbscience2018/). 

- The paper was published in early 2020: Li R, Nordio R, Huang CC, Contreras C, Calderon R, Yataco R, Galea JT, Zhang Z, Becerra MC, Lecca L, Murray MB, [Two Clinical Prediction Tools to Improve Tuberculosis Contact Investigation](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciz1221/5697300), *Clinical Infectious Diseases*

### Nutrition intervention in China

We developed a worksite-based intervention in Pudong, Shanghai, collaborating with the Pudong Institute for Health Development and [Prof. Lindsay Jaacks](http://lindsayjaacks.com/) at HSPH.
