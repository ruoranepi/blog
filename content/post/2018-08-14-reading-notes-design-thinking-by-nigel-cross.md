Nigel Cross: [“Design Thinking.”](https://books.google.com/books/about/Design_Thinking.html?id=NbZUA0HjdbYC)

Informative book that helps me to reflect the design (research) process as an independent researcher.

## Quotes 

“... designing is not a search for the optimum solution to the given problem, but that it is an exploratory process. The creative designer interprets the design brief not as a specification for a solution, but as a starting point for a journey of exploration; the designer sets off to explore, to discover something new, rather than to reach somewhere already known, or to return with yet another example of the already familiar.”
