Several key concepts and learnings: 

### LAGO evaluation design 

Learn-as-you-go design presented by [Daniel Nevo](https://danielnevo.wordpress.com/) (paper not published yet): contrast with [other types of trial designs](https://methodology.psu.edu/ra/adap-inter).

### The [Kirkpatrick Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Kirkpatrick#Four_Levels_of_Learning_Evaluation) of learning evaluation:

1. Reaction - what participants thought and felt about the training (satisfaction; "smile sheets")
2. Learning - the resulting increase in knowledge and/or skills, and change in attitudes. This evaluation occurs during the training in the form of either a knowledge demonstration or test.
3. Behavior - transfer of knowledge, skills, and/or attitudes from classroom to the job (change in job behavior due to training program). This evaluation occurs 3â€“6 months post training while the trainee is performing the job. Evaluation usually occurs through observation.
4. Results - the final results that occurred because of attendance and participation in a training program (can be monetary, performance-based, etc.)

### Scalability

We also heard about some qualitative research fon Mental Health training interventions in India - [the ESSENCE (Enabling translation of Science to Service to ENhance Depression CarE) project](http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/U19-MH113211-01). 

One main question I have is regarding scalability of projects: should we repeat the qualitative phase, and redesign interventions, when we are to scale to a different population? -- probably context-dependent.
