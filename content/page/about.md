I am a graduate student in epidemiology in the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/). Iâ€™m interested in using epidemiologic methods to identify targeted interventions for high risk populations. Before starting my doctoral degree, I worked in the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/) studying cancer survival disparities in the UK, France and Japan. For my doctoral thesis, I am working on using both infectious disease modeling and machine learning techniques to inform tuberculosis control strategies.
