      <description>Transitioning from Stata to R is painful. So for over half a year, I was using base R for data cleaning and manipulation (double PAINFUL!), before finally having time to learn the many uses of the dplyr package. Life is so much simpler. All thanks go to YouTube videos from Prof. Roger Peng: timesaver and lifesaver!</description>

      <description>Several key concepts and learnings:
LAGO evaluation design Learn-as-you-go design presented by Daniel Nevo (paper not published yet): contrast with other types of trial designs.
The Kirkpatrick Model of learning evaluation:  Reaction - what participants thought and felt about the training (satisfaction; &amp;ldquo;smile sheets&amp;rdquo;) Learning - the resulting increase in knowledge and/or skills, and change in attitudes. This evaluation occurs during the training in the form of either a knowledge demonstration or test.</description>
