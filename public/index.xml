      <description>I am a graduate student in epidemiology in the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I’m interested in using epidemiologic methods to identify targeted interventions for high risk populations. Before starting my doctoral degree, I worked in the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine studying cancer survival disparities in the UK, France and Japan. For my doctoral thesis, I am working on using both infectious disease modeling and machine learning techniques to inform tuberculosis control strategies.</description>
