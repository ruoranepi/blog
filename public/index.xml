      <description>I am a graduate student in epidemiology in the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Iâ€™m interested in using epidemiologic methods to identify targeted interventions for high risk populations. Before starting my doctoral degree, I worked in the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine studying cancer survival disparities in the UK, France and Japan. For my doctoral thesis, I am working on using both infectious disease modeling and machine learning techniques to inform tuberculosis control strategies.</description>
