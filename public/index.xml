      <description>Active projects Developing a tuberculosis risk score I&amp;rsquo;m developing a tool to describe the distribution of TB risks in a population. Preliminary results were presented at the 50th Union World Conference on Lung Health in Hyderabad, India, on October 31, 2019.
COVID-19 inpatient resource needs As part of my doctoral thesis, I&amp;rsquo;m estimating the inpatient hospitalization needs for COVID-19.
Previous projects TB contact investigation in Peru I have developed tools that could inform tuberculosis contact investigation and preventive therapy for pulmonary TB patients and their contacts in Lima, Peru with Prof.</description>

      <description>Nigel Cross: “Design Thinking.”
Informative book that helps me to reflect the design (research) process as an independent researcher.
Quotes “&amp;hellip; designing is not a search for the optimum solution to the given problem, but that it is an exploratory process. The creative designer interprets the design brief not as a specification for a solution, but as a starting point for a journey of exploration; the designer sets off to explore, to discover something new, rather than to reach somewhere already known, or to return with yet another example of the already familiar.</description>

      <description>Transitioning from Stata to R is painful. So for over half a year, I was using base R for data cleaning and manipulation (double PAINFUL!), before finally having time to learn the many uses of the dplyr package. Life is so much simpler. All thanks go to YouTube videos from Prof. Roger Peng: timesaver and lifesaver!</description>

      <description>Lindsay Jaacks: US meat consumption is declining, but increasing globally. In China, meat production is increasing by 2 kg per person per year. (And diabetes is associated with small elevation by half serving of meat consumption in Nurses.) Global vegetable intake is low, and fruit intake is even lower.
 Carol Boushey: Food co-ocurrence pattern over time from new technologies that capture food intake. Interesting way to visualize multiple exposures.</description>

      <description>Several key concepts and learnings:
LAGO evaluation design Learn-as-you-go design presented by Daniel Nevo (paper not published yet): contrast with other types of trial designs.
The Kirkpatrick Model of learning evaluation:  Reaction - what participants thought and felt about the training (satisfaction; &amp;ldquo;smile sheets&amp;rdquo;) Learning - the resulting increase in knowledge and/or skills, and change in attitudes. This evaluation occurs during the training in the form of either a knowledge demonstration or test.</description>

      <title>Starting with R codes in tidyverse</title>
      <link>/2018/05/04/try-r-codes-and-plots/</link>

      <description>Set up I’m following the R for data science book to learn some better practices for organizing my analyses. My motivation for this is that I’ve only just realized that I have been using base R for most of my previous data cleaning works – maybe I should start learning to use packages that can simplify this process.
tidyverse may be the place to start (heard about it from Roger Peng and Hilary Parker’s podcast).</description>

Title: Principles of Tuberculosis Elimination and the Zero TB Initiative
Presenter: Mercedes Becerra, ScD. Professor, Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Harvard Medical School Associate Epidemiologist, Division of Global Health Equity, Brigham and Women’s Hospital Senior TB Specialist, Partners In Health
A substandard of TB control has been mainstream Based on current trend, it will take 200 years for the global incidence to be at the same level as TB incidence in the US.</description>

      <description>Notes from a talk by Kendall Hoyt, ID epi seminar series.
During WWII, the world is very productive in developing and improving many vaccines.
Many barriers are organizational, not scientific.
What are some of the good organizational characteristics that facilitate speedy development?
 Top down governance Integrated across developmental phases and diciplines Situated in a community that facilitates information transfer  CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) - defines the problem as a speed problem.</description>

      <description>I am a graduate student in epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. For my doctoral dissertation, I am developing evidence-based prediction tools that would help healthcare providers in lower- and middle-income countries to better target tuberculosis control strategies.
Prior to my graduate work, I studied in the University of Cambridge and conducted research on the risky decision-making process using experimental psychology techniques as my undergraduate thesis. I then worked in the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine studying cancer survival disparities in the UK, France and Japan.</description>
