<p>Title: Principles of Tuberculosis Elimination and the Zero TB Initiative</p>

<p>Presenter: Mercedes Becerra, ScD. Professor, Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Harvard Medical School
Associate Epidemiologist, Division of Global Health Equity, Brigham and Women’s Hospital
Senior TB Specialist, Partners In Health</p>

<h2 id="a-substandard-of-tb-control-has-been-mainstream">A substandard of TB control has been mainstream</h2>

<p>Based on current trend, it will take 200 years for the global incidence to be at the same level as TB incidence in the US.</p>

<p>TB is treatable, yet, there are still 2 million deaths per year. How about zero TB death first?</p>

<h2 id="there-are-four-gaps-the-zero-tb-initiative-addresses">There are four gaps the Zero TB Initiative addresses:</h2>

<h3 id="1-from-fetishizes-one-form-of-tb-to-all-tb-counts">1. From <em>fetishizes one form of TB</em> to <em>all TB counts</em></h3>

<p>A spectrum of M.TB: but now we only focus on &ldquo;infection&rdquo; and &ldquo;disease&rdquo; that are diagnosed using current technologies. But doesn’t look at the other types and forms of TB that are not easily diagnosed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Only 10% of kids will be found to be sick by smear (less likely to have sputum, many have TB outside of the lung). If we only use smear to diagnose (cheaper/easier), we are not going to see other cases. In fact, TB in children is the leading cause of infertility in many parts of the world.</li>
<li>Similarly, HIV patients are less likely to be smear positive.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The big problem in TB is that we don’t know who’s going to be sick.</strong> If we knew, we can focus on who’s going to be sick to treat.</p>

<h3 id="2-from-no-cost-or-low-cost-to-cost-saving">2. From <em>No cost or low cost</em> to <em>cost saving</em></h3>

<p>We should put in more resources now, which will lead to saving cost after (near-)elimination.</p>

<h3 id="3-from-national-data-decision-to-local">3. From <em>national (data/decision)</em> to <em>local</em></h3>

<p><strong>There are no national TB epidemics.</strong> Need local response.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Smith County, Texas, USA. Focus on high incidence neighbourhood &mdash; overall incidence reduction, but most remarkably, no new TB cases in these high incidence neighbourhoods.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="4-from-different-goals-and-time-scales-to-the-same-goal-elimination-and-one-scale">4. From <em>different goals and time-scales</em> to <em>the same goal (elimination) and one scale</em></h3>

<p>Case notificaiton and incidence (true burden) are different across the globe. In many parts of the worlds, case notification &lt;&lt; incidence.</p>

<p>The scale is very different across regions of the world, making it hard to compare gaps in incidence/notification.</p>

<p>In most places, we have not been thinking about driving rates down to elimination. There&rsquo;s a built-in equity gap within the WHO End TB strategy, even after every country meets targets in 2025 (50% reduction).</p>

<p>Definitions (who’s defining those definitions? Or should we define our own definitions?):</p>

<ul>
<li>Control: no change in incidence. this is what we’re doing now.</li>
<li>Elimination.</li>
</ul>

<p>Social construction of a double standard.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Alaska from 1950s to 2000s as an example of what can be achieved.</p>
