      <description>Transitioning from Stata to R is painful. So for over half a year, I was using base R for data cleaning and manipulation (double PAINFUL!), before finally having time to learn the many uses of the dplyr package. Life is so much simpler. All thanks go to YouTube videos from Prof. Roger Peng: timesaver and lifesaver!</description>

      <description>Set up I’m following the R for data science book to learn some better practices for organizing my analyses. My motivation for this is that I’ve only just realized that I have been using base R for most of my previous data cleaning works – maybe I should start learning to use packages that can simplify this process.
tidyverse may be the place to start (heard about it from Roger Peng and Hilary Parker’s podcast).</description>
