      <description>I am a graduate student in epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. For my doctoral dissertation, I am developing evidence-based prediction tools that would help healthcare providers in lower- and middle-income countries to better target tuberculosis control strategies.
Prior to my graduate work, I studied in the University of Cambridge and conducted research on the risky decision-making process using experimental psychology techniques as my undergraduate thesis. I then worked in the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine studying cancer survival disparities in the UK, France and Japan.</description>
